-- Assume you are given the table containing measurement values obtained from a Google sensor over several days. 
-- Measurements are taken several times within a given day.
-- Write a query to obtain the sum of the odd-numbered and even-numbered measurements on a particular day, in two different columns.Â 


create table measurements
(measurement_id int,
measurement_value float,
measurement_time timestamp
);

insert into measurements values (131233,1109.51,'2022-07-10 09:00:00');
insert into measurements values (135211,1662.74,'2022-07-10 11:00:00');
